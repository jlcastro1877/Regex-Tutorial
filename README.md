## Regex Components

### Anchors
###/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###Anchors are a different breed. They do not match any character at all. Instead, they match a position before, after, or between characters. They can be used to “anchor” the regex match at a certain position. The caret ^ matches the position before the first character ###in the string. Applying ^a to abc matches a. ^b does not match abc at all, because the b cannot be matched right after the start of the string, matched by ^. See below for the inside view of the regex engine. Similarly, $ matches right after the last character in the ###string. c$ matches c in abc, while a$ does not match at all.

### Quantifiers
###^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###Quantifiers are used to communicate how many characters are expected. Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many ###characters as possible. If the ",+,?,{}" characters are found within regular expressions, they are considered quantifiers. The ? indicates the expression to match 0 or 1time. As mentioned in the summary above because there are 2 types of formats we'll use the or ###operator to distinguish which format we are using. In our Hex Value regular expression we have {6} (Hex Triplet Format) and {3} (Shorthand Hex Format), this indicates that the length of the component preceding these quantifiers should be 6 for {6} and 3 for {3}.
### OR Operator
###/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###The "or" operator within a regular expression is defined using the | element. The or operator indicates that it could either of the components that we are separating with the |. For our hex value regular expression we have ([a-f0-9]{6}``|``[a-f0-9]{3}). Note the or ###operator separating these 2 components. This means that our hex value could either be 6 characters [a-f0-9]{6} or 3 characters [a-f0-9]{3}.
### Character Classes
###/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###Character classes are components within our regular expression that tells us what type of characters to expect. In our example our character classes are confined within brackets []. For our example we have 2 character classes: [a-f0-9] and [a-f0-9] which searches for ###the same values. We will be breaking down what the characters are searching within these character classes. a-f searches for letters a-f and 0-9 searches for digits 0-9.
### Flags
###In regular expressions (regex), flags are special characters or settings that modify how the pattern is matched against the input text. Flags can be used to change the behavior of the regex engine, making it case-insensitive, multiline-aware, and more. Here are some ###common flags:
###i (case-insensitive): Makes the regex pattern case-insensitive. For example, (?i)abc will match "ABC", "Abc", "aBc", etc.
###m (multiline): Changes the behavior of ^ and $ so that they match the start and end of each line within the input, not just the start and end of the entire input. For example, /^abc/m will match "abc" at the beginning of any line in a multiline string.
###s (dotall): Allows the dot . to match newline characters as well, so it matches any character including line breaks. For example, /a.b/s will match "a\nb".
###x (extended): Allows you to include whitespace and comments in your regex pattern for readability. For example, /a \s+ b/x can be written with spaces and comments for clarity.
###u (unicode): Ensures that the pattern is treated as Unicode. This is useful for working with Unicode characters and can affect how certain characters are matched.
###g (global): In some languages or tools, this flag allows the regex to find all matches in the input string rather than stopping after the first match. This is commonly used in languages like JavaScript.
###Flags are typically applied at the end of the regex pattern. For instance, in JavaScript, you would use them like this: /pattern/flags. In Python, you use them as parameters in the re.compile() function, like re.compile(r'pattern', re.IGNORECASE)
### Grouping and Capturing
###In regular expressions, grouping and capturing are powerful features that allow you to manage and extract parts of matched text.
###Grouping
###Grouping is done using parentheses (). It allows you to apply quantifiers to part of a regex pattern or to capture specific substrings for later use.
###Examples:
###Basic Grouping: (abc) matches the substring "abc". This doesn't capture it; it's just for grouping.
###Quantifiers with Groups: (abc)+ matches one or more repetitions of "abc" (e.g., "abcabc", "abcabcabc").
###Nested Groups: ((abc)d) groups "abc" and "d" together, which is useful for more complex patterns.
###Capturing
###Capturing is done when you use parentheses () to not only group parts of the regex but also extract the matched substrings. Each group is assigned a capture number starting from 1 (the whole match is capture 0).
###Examples:
###Single Capture Group: (\d{3}) captures three digits. For the input "12345", it captures "123" as group 1.
###Multiple Capture Groups: (\d{3})-(\d{2}) captures two groups: the first three digits and the next two digits. For "123-45", group 1 is "123" and group 2 is "45".
###Non-Capturing Groups
###Sometimes you need to group parts of your regex but don't need to capture them. For this, you use non-capturing groups (?:...).
###Examples:
###Non-Capturing Group: (?:abc)+ matches one or more repetitions of "abc" but does not capture them.
###Named Capturing Groups
###Some regex flavors (like those in Python, JavaScript, and others) allow you to name your capture groups for easier reference.
###Examples:
###Named Capture Group in Python: (?P<area_code>\d{3})-(?P<local_number>\d{4}) captures digits into named groups "area_code" and "local_number".
###python
###Copy code
###import re
###pattern = re.compile(r'(?P<area_code>\d{3})-(?P<local_number>\d{4})')
###match = pattern.match('123-4567')
###print(match.group('area_code'))  # Output: 123
###print(match.group('local_number'))  # Output: 4567
###Named Capture Group in JavaScript: /(?<areaCode>\d{3})-(?<localNumber>\d{4})/ captures digits into named groups "areaCode" and "localNumber".
###javascript
###Copy code
###const pattern = /(?<areaCode>\d{3})-(?<localNumber>\d{4})/;
###const match = pattern.exec('123-4567');
###console.log(match.groups.areaCode);  // Output: 123
###console.log(match.groups.localNumber);  // Output: 4567
###Summary
###Grouping (()) helps with organizing parts of a regex and applying quantifiers.
###Capturing allows you to extract substrings matched by specific groups.
###Non-Capturing Groups ((?:...)) group without capturing.
###Named Capturing Groups make it easier to reference and work with specific captured data.
###These features enhance the flexibility and utility of regular expressions, especially in complex pattern matching and text extraction tasks.
### Bracket Expressions
###/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###Matches any character in the square brackets. For example [nN] [oO] matches no, nO, No, and NO. gr[ae]y matches both spellings of the word 'grey'; that is, gray and grey.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
###/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
###A greedy match tries to match an element as many times as possible. Whereas, a lazy match tries to match an element as few times as possible. In our example we have ? which signifies lazy quantifier. This is referred to a lazy quantifier because it causes the regular ###expression engine to match as few occurances as possible. We can simply turn this lazy match into a greedy one by adding a ?.
